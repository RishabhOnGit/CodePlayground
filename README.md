# üöÄ Code Playground

A powerful web-based coding playground for multiple programming languages with features including GitHub integration, code saving, and more.

## üìã Project Overview

This project is a full-stack web application with:
- Frontend hosted on Vercel: https://playgroundcode.vercel.app/
- Backend API hosted on Render: https://try-j2gk.onrender.com/

## üåê Frontend (Vercel Deployment)

The frontend consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that create the user interface for the code playground.

### Main Components
- **HTML Pages:** index.html, playground.html, language.html, admin-panel.html, github-callback.html
- **CSS Files:** style.css, playgroundstyle.css, languagestyle.css
- **JavaScript Files:** script.js, playgroundscript.js, languagescript.js, github-config.js, github-utils.js, etc.

## üñ•Ô∏è Backend (Render Deployment)

The backend server handles GitHub authentication and repository operations. It's built with Node.js and Express.

### Main Components
- **server.js:** Main server file with API endpoints
- **package.json:** Dependencies and scripts
- **.env:** Environment variables for configuration

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

1. Create a Vercel account: https://vercel.com/signup
2. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
3. Navigate to the project root directory
4. Run `vercel login` and follow the prompts
5. Run `vercel` to deploy
6. Set up automatic deployments from GitHub (optional)

### Backend Deployment (Render)

1. Create a Render account: https://render.com/register
2. Create a new Web Service
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure the service:
   - Name: try-j2gk
   - Root Directory: server/
   - Environment: Node
   - Build Command: `npm install`
   - Start Command: `node server.js`
5. Add the following environment variables:
   - GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
   - GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
   - REDIRECT_URI=https://playgroundcode.vercel.app/github-callback.html
   - FRONTEND_URL=https://playgroundcode.vercel.app

## üìù Configuration

Make sure to update GitHub OAuth app settings with your new production URLs and update API endpoints in the frontend code to point to the Render backend. For GitHub OAuth, use:
- Authorization callback URL: https://playgroundcode.vercel.app/github-callback.html
